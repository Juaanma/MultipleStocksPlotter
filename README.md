# Multiple Stocks Plotter
A stocks plotter to visualize multiple stocks in the same chart,
with separated y axes so that the proportions are the same and 
the relative changes are more obvious.
The data is downloaded from Google Finances, and the only valid
stock IDs are those used by Google. Some stocks or indexes may not have the
"historial prices" option available in the Google Finances site, and
therefore cannot be used in this program.
